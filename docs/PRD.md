# ATRIUM — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview

Atrium is a personal digital museum platform that transforms user-uploaded memories into immersive architectural spaces.

Current Phase: Waitlist Validation
Future Phase: MVP (Immersive Memory Gallery)

---

# 2. Problem Statement

Memories today live in:

* Social media feeds
* Cloud storage grids
* Disorganized folders

These formats compress emotional significance into scrollable noise.

Users lack a spatial, intentional way to experience their memories.

---

# 3. Vision

To create a digital space where memories are not scrolled — but entered.

Atrium is not a storage tool.
It is an experience layer over personal memory.

---

# 4. Phase 1 — Waitlist Validation

## Objective

Validate demand before building the MVP.

## Scope

* Landing page
* Clear value proposition
* Process explanation
* Email capture
* Minimal preloader

## Success Metrics

* 300–500 unique visitors
* 20%+ conversion = strong signal
* 10–15% = moderate
* <5% = messaging refinement needed

---

# 5. Phase 2 — MVP

## Core Flow

1. Upload photos
2. System generates architectural layout
3. User enters immersive gallery
4. Scroll-based navigation

## MVP Constraints

* Fake 3D (CSS perspective)
* No authentication initially
* No sharing
* No complex customization

## Core Emotional Moment

User sees their own memories displayed like curated art.

---

# 6. Feature Roadmap

## Phase 3

* Authentication
* Private galleries
* Shareable exhibition links
* Themed room presets

## Phase 4

* True 3D rendering
* Real-time lighting

# 7. Technical Stack

Frontend:

* Next.js (App Router)
* Tailwind CSS

Image Optimization:

* WebP
* Lazy loading

Deployment:

---

# 8. Non-Goals (For Now)

* Social feed
* AI auto-tagging
* Heavy dashboard UI
* Complex analytics

Atrium is an experience-first product.

---

# 9. Brand Positioning

Tone:

* Architectural
* Calm
* Minimal
* Intentional

Not:

* Luxury-fashion
* Startup-hype
* Tech-heavy

---

# 10. Risk Assessment

Risk 1: Overbuilding before validation
Mitigation: Ship small, test early

Risk 2: Performance-heavy animations
Mitigation: Optimize assets, restrict motion

Risk 3: Brand inconsistency
Mitigation: Enforce visual rules document
