# ATRIUM — Development Rules

These rules govern all development decisions for Atrium.

---

# 1. Ship Small

We validate before we scale.
No feature is built without purpose.

---

# 2. Experience First

If a feature does not enhance the emotional core moment, it is removed.

Core moment:
User entering a space containing their memories.

---

# 3. Minimal by Default

* No extra buttons
* No unnecessary settings
* No cluttered UI

Every element must justify its existence.

---

# 4. Performance Is Brand

Fast load = premium feel.
Slow experience = brand damage.

All images optimized.
All animations measured.

---

# 5. Motion Discipline

* No bounce animations
* No dramatic overshoots
* No distracting transitions

Motion must feel architectural.

---

# 6. Visual Consistency

* Black or near-black backgrounds
* Soft white typography
* Clean geometry
* Controlled spacing

No random design experiments.

---

# 7. Avoid Overengineering

We do not build:

* Complex backends prematurely
* Heavy 3D engines early
* Social layers before core experience

---

# 8. Refactor When Necessary

Code must remain clean.
Technical debt must not accumulate.

---

# 9. Respect the Brand

Atrium is:

* Architectural
* Calm
* Intentional

Not:

* Trendy
* Flashy
* Loud
